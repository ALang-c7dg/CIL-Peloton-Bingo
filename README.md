# CIL-Peloton-Bingo

**Updates 7/31/2021**

The Bingo Card has been re-created!  It now has an actual HTML page and uses DOM manipulation for changes to the page.  No more document.write to create the entire Bingo card.
Much easier to follow what's happening.

**History of the Bingo Card:**

Central Illinois Peloton Bingo began in the spring of 2020.  I had taken an entry level JS class a couple months prior and was curious if I could do anything with JS.  
The initial code was not good.  It created one long string that represented the document and then did a document.write, if I recall correctly.  Anyway, it worked and 
I was able to generate Bingo cards to challenge our CIL Peloton riders during the early days of the pandemic.
