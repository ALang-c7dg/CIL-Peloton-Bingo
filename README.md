# CIL-Peloton-Bingo
Central Illinois Peloton Bingo began in the spring of 2020.  I had taken an entry level JS class a couple months prior and was curious if I could do anything with JS.  
The initial code is not good.  Didn't really know what I was doing.  Copied some stuff from the web.  Came up with something that created Bingo cards to challenge our 
CIL Peloton riders during the early days of the pandemic.  

Now its time to improve the card generation process.  The intial changes will improve the card generation process with better structured JS.
